### app/Emc2NoactivityTabbed
emc2noactivitytabbed app provides assistance for special relativity calculations.  

This app also serves as a playground for me to learn how a tabbed activity is composed   
from scratch, without using any of templates available in Android Studio.<br>  
Those templates mostly tend to be too complicated in my taste to start with.


### app/TakePhoto
Take a photo using AndroidX Activity Result API
